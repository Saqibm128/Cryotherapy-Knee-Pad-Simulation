    "* $t$ is the time variable.\n",

    "* $T_w$ as the temperature of water flowing throughout the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "* We assume the water has initial temperature of $0 C$\n",
    "* We assume that the fresh blood perfusing the tissue underneath the skin is constant at temperature $37 C$ and the skin starts at same temperature.\n",
    "* We assume that the surface area of the capillary bed is the same as the surface area of the knee as a whole (i.e. that fresh blood is constantly being in contact with the tissue.\n",
    "* We assume that heat transfer from the knee skin to the environment is negligible.\n",
    "* We assume that the motor contributes negligible.\n",
    "* We assume that the sleeve material will start at the same temperature as the ice water.\n",
